# MDX: Markdown for the component era 🚀

[![Build Status][build-badge]][build]
[![Join the community on Spectrum][spectrum-badge]][spectrum]

[MDX][website] is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly use JSX in your markdown documents.
You can import components, like interactive charts or notifications, and export
metadata.
This makes writing long-form content with components a blast. 

## Example

See MDX in action:

```jsx
import { Chart } from '../components/chart'

# Here’s a chart

The chart is rendered inside our MDX document.

<Chart />
```

## Intro

MDX is markdown for the component era.
It lets you write JSX embedded inside markdown.
That’s a great combination because it allows you to use markdown’s often terse
syntax (such as `# heading`) for the little things and JSX for more advanced
components.

:heart: **Powerful**: MDX blends markdown and JSX syntax to fit perfectly in
React/JSX-based projects.

:computer: **Everything is a component**: Use existing components inside your
MDX and import other MDX files as plain components.

:wrench: **Customizable**: Decide which component is rendered for each markdown
element (`{ h1: MyHeading }`).

:books: **Markdown-based**: The simplicity and elegance of markdown remains,
you interleave JSX only when you want to.

:fire: **Blazingly blazing fast**: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs
during the build stage.

## Getting started

```shell
npm init mdx
```

Visit [`mdxjs.com`][website] for more info, and check out [Contribute][] below
to find out how to help out.

## Why?

Before MDX, some of the benefits of writing markdown were lost when integrating
with JSX.
Implementations were often template string-based which required lots of escaping
and cumbersome syntax.

MDX seeks to make writing with markdown *and* JSX simpler while being more
expressive.
The possibilities are endless when you combine components (that can even be
dynamic or load data) with the simplicity of markdown for long-form content.
A nice example of this is [mdx-deck][], a great way to create slides with MDX.
