Markdown for the\
**component era**
=================

MDX lets you use JSX in your markdown content.
You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them
within your content.
This makes writing long-form content with components a blast. {/* more */}

<div className="card big">
  ## New: MDX 3!

  A small major this time, nothing big, which is also nice sometimes!
  This mainly drops support for old Node (use 16 or later), adds modern ES2024
  support in MDX, supports `await` in MDX (if your framework does too), and
  removes several deprecated options.

## What does MDX do?

<div className="big-columns">
  <div>
    You write markdown with embedded components through JSX:

    ```mdx path="example.mdx"
    import {Chart} from './snowfall.js'
    export const year = 2023

    # Last year‚Äôs snowfall

    In {year}, the snowfall was above average.
    It was followed by a warm spring which caused
    flood conditions in many of the nearby rivers.

    <Chart year={year} color="#fcb32c" />
    ```
  </div>

  <div>
    It gets compiled to JavaScript that you can use in any framework that
    supports JSX:

    {/* lint disable */}

    <div className="home-preview">
      # Last year‚Äôs snowfall

      In {year}, the snowfall was above average.
      It was followed by a warm spring which caused flood conditions in many of
      the nearby rivers.

      <Chart year={year} color="#fcb32c" />
    </div>

    {/* lint enable */}
  </div>
</div>

We made an interactive playground where you can try MDX out and see what it
turns into.

## Get started

There are integrations for most bundlers, frameworks, and editors.
Whether you build with Docusaurus, Next.js, or Vite.
You prefer Rollup, esbuild, or webpack.
You‚Äôre using React, Preact, or Vue.

## MDX in short

<div className="emoji-list">
  * ‚ù§Ô∏è **Powerful**: MDX blends markdown and JSX syntax to fit perfectly in
    JSX-based projects
  * üíª **Everything is a component**: Use existing components in your
    MDX and import other MDX files as components
  * üîß **Customizable**: Decide which component is rendered for each markdown
    construct (`{h1: MyHeading}`)
  * üìö **Markdown-based**: The simplicity and elegance of markdown remains,
    you use JSX only when you want to
  * üî• **Blazingly blazing fast**: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs
    during the build stage
