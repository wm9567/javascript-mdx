# MDX Specification

MDX includes a [specification][spec] to define the syntax and transpilation.
This can be leveraged by code formatters, linters, and implementations in other
languages created by the community.
Itâ€™s based on the [remark][]/[unified][] ecosystem to ensure robust parsing and
the ability to leverage plugins from within your MDX.
