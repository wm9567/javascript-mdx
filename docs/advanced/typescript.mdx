# TypeScript

MDX provides typings for many of the core packages.

If you want to improve upon the types, we would _love_ a PR to
improve the developer experience for TypeScript users.

## Typings for Components and Utilities

- `@mdx-js/mdx`
- `@mdx-js/react`
- `@mdx-js/runtime`
- `@mdx-js/vue`
- `@mdx-js/util`
- `remark-mdx`
- `remark-mdx-remove-exports`
- `remark-mdx-remove-imports`

Include types, no additional setup needed.
