# TypeScript

<!--
TODO: this feels like it’s placed weirdly.
Where could it go?
-->

Below are some basic typings to get started with:

```tsx
declare module '@mdx-js/react' {
  import * as React from 'react'

  type ComponentType =
    | 'p'
    | 'h1'
    | 'h2'
    | 'h3'
    | 'h4'
    | 'h5'
    | 'h6'
    | 'thematicBreak'
    | 'blockquote'
    | 'ul'
    | 'ol'
    | 'li'
    | 'table'
    | 'tr'
    | 'td'
    | 'pre'
    | 'code'
    | 'em'
    | 'strong'
    | 'delete'
    | 'inlineCode'
    | 'hr'
    | 'a'
    | 'img'

  export type Components = {
    [key in ComponentType]?: React.ComponentType<{children: React.ReactNode}>
  }

  export interface MDXProviderProps {
    children: React.ReactNode
    components: Components
  }
  export class MDXProvider extends React.Component<MDXProviderProps> {}
}
```

If you want to improve upon the types we would _love_ a PR to
improve the developer experience for TypeScript users.

If you’re getting errors from TypeScript related to imports with an `*.mdx`
extension, create an `mdx.d.ts` file in your types directory and include it
inside your `tsconfig.json`.

```tsx
// types/mdx.d.ts
declare module '*.mdx' {
  let MDXComponent: (props: any) => JSX.Element
  export default MDXComponent
}
```
