# Table of components

[`MDXProvider`](/getting-started/#mdxprovider) uses React Context to provide the component mapping
internally to MDX when it renders.
The following components are rendered from Markdown, so these can be keys in the
component object you pass to `MDXProvider`.

<TableOfComponents />
