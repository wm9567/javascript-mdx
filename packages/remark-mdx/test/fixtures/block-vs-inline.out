# Block vs. inline

To make this example more readable, uppercase letters are used when JSX is
parsed as a block, wheres lowercase letters are used for inline JSX.

This is inline, itâ€™s a paragraph, because `<x>` is followed by `_`.

<x>*alpha<y/>*</x>

This is inline too, not a heading:

<x># hea
ding</x>

This is a block: there is nothing before or after the tags.

<X>
  One paragraph.

  Two paragraph.
</X>

Blocks can be self-closing:

<X/>
