Jump in there and lurk, talk to us, and help others.

## Contributions

There‚Äôs several ways to contribute, not just by writing code.

### Financial support

It‚Äôs possible to support us financially by becoming a backer or sponsor of
unified through [Open Collective][collective].
With this support, we can pay for project leadership, finance non-coding work,
or to do fun things for the community like getting stickers for contributors.
You‚Äôll be helping unified‚Äôs maintainers manage and improve existing projects,
and additionally support our work to develop new and exciting projects, such
as [micromark][].

### Improve documentation

As a user of this project you‚Äôre perfect for helping us improve our docs.
Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, new examples, etcetera.
Anything!

### Improve issues

Some issues lack information, aren‚Äôt reproducible, or are just incorrect.
Help make them easier to resolve.

### Give feedback on issues and pull requests

We‚Äôre always looking for more opinions on discussions in the issue tracker.

### Write code

Code contributions are very welcome.  It‚Äôs often good to first create an issue
to report a bug or suggest a new feature before creating a pull request to
prevent you from doing unnecessary work.

## Running the tests

1.  `yarn`
2.  `yarn lerna exec yarn install`
3.  `yarn bootstrap`
4.  `yarn test`

## Submitting an issue

*   The issue tracker is for issues.  Use chat for support
*   Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new
    issue
*   Ensure you‚Äôre using the latest version of our packages
*   Use a clear and descriptive title
*   Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue,
    error message, version, operating system, etcetera
*   The more time you put into an issue, the better we will be able to help you
*   The best issue report is a [failing test][unit-test] proving it

## Submitting a pull request

*   Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent
    you from doing unnecessary work
*   For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the
    community for feedback as soon as possible
*   New features should be accompanied with tests and documentation
*   Don‚Äôt include unrelated changes
*   Test before submitting code by running `yarn test`
*   Write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request:
    it‚Äôs your job to convince us
